# Understanding `posedge clk or posedge reset` in Verilog

## What is a Sensitivity List?

In Verilog, the sensitivity list (the part after `@`) tells the simulator **when** to execute the code inside an `always` block. The block only runs when one of the events in the sensitivity list occurs.

## Breaking Down `posedge clk or posedge reset`

### `posedge` - Positive Edge

- **`posedge`** means "positive edge" or "rising edge"
- It triggers when a signal transitions from **0 to 1** (LOW to HIGH)
- Only the **rising edge** causes the block to execute

### The Complete Expression

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    // This code executes when:
    // 1. clk goes from 0 → 1, OR
    // 2. reset goes from 0 → 1
end
```

## Visual Timing Diagram

```
Time:     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
         ┌─┐   ┌─┐   ┌─┐   ┌─┐   ┌─┐
clk:   ──┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───
         ↑     ↑     ↑     ↑     ↑
       Execute Execute Execute Execute Execute

reset: ────────┐       ┌─────────────────
               └───────┘
                       ↑
                     Execute
```

**Execution points**: The always block runs at times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8.

## Why Use This Pattern?

This sensitivity list is the **standard pattern for synchronous logic with asynchronous reset**:

### 1. **Synchronous Operation** (`posedge clk`)
- Normal operation is synchronized to the clock
- Data changes only on clock edges
- Provides predictable timing

### 2. **Asynchronous Reset** (`posedge reset`)
- Reset can happen **immediately**, without waiting for clock
- Provides instant system initialization
- Critical for reliable startup behavior

## Common Usage Pattern

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        // ASYNCHRONOUS RESET
        // This happens immediately when reset goes HIGH
        // No need to wait for clock edge
        output_signal <= 0;
        state <= IDLE;
    end else begin
        // SYNCHRONOUS OPERATION
        // This happens only on positive clock edges
        // when reset is not active
        output_signal <= input_signal;
        state <= next_state;
    end
end
```

## Types of Sensitivity Lists

### 1. **Synchronous with Async Reset** (Most Common)
```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
```
- Clock-driven operation with immediate reset capability

### 2. **Pure Synchronous**
```verilog
always @(posedge clk)
```
- Everything happens on clock edges only
- Reset also waits for clock edge (synchronous reset)

### 3. **Combinational Logic**
```verilog
always @(*)  // or always @(a or b or c)
```
- Executes whenever any input changes
- No clock involved

### 4. **Negative Edge Triggered**
```verilog
always @(negedge clk or posedge reset)
```
- Triggers on falling edge of clock (1 → 0)

## Example from Your Code

Looking at your `loop_examples.v`:

```verilog
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
    if (reset) begin
        sum = 0;  // Immediate reset when reset signal rises
    end else begin
        sum = 0;  // On each clock rise (when reset is not active)
        repeat (count) begin
            sum = sum + 5;
        end
    end
end
```

**Behavior**:
- **When `reset` goes 0→1**: Immediately set `sum = 0` (don't wait for clock)
- **When `clk` goes 0→1** (and reset is 0): Execute the repeat loop logic

## Key Points to Remember

1. **`or` means either event triggers execution** - it's not a logical OR operation
2. **`posedge` only triggers on 0→1 transitions** - staying at 1 doesn't trigger
3. **This pattern enables both synchronous operation and asynchronous reset**
4. **The `if (reset)` check inside determines which action to take**
5. **Reset typically takes priority** - checked first in the if-else structure

## Alternative Edge Types

| Keyword | Meaning | Trigger Condition |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| `posedge` | Positive/Rising Edge | 0 → 1 transition |
| `negedge` | Negative/Falling Edge | 1 → 0 transition |
| No keyword | Level Sensitive | Any change in signal |

## Best Practices

1. **Use `posedge clk or posedge reset`** for most sequential logic
2. **Always check reset first** in the if-else structure
3. **Use non-blocking assignments (`<=`)** for sequential logic (though your code uses blocking `=`)
4. **Keep sensitivity lists simple** - avoid complex expressions

This pattern is fundamental to digital design and represents how most real hardware flip-flops and registers behave with clock and reset inputs.
