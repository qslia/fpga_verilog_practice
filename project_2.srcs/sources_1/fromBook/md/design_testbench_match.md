I'll analyze both files to see if the testbench and source file match each other properly.

Yes, these files **do match each other** perfectly! Here's the analysis:

## Source File (`project_2.srcs/sources_1/fromBook/TestBenchWriting.v`)
- **Module name**: `mux_gl`
- **Inputs**: `a`, `b`, `s`
- **Output**: `y`
- **Functionality**: A 2-to-1 multiplexer implemented using gate-level primitives
  - When `s = 0`: output `y = a`
  - When `s = 1`: output `y = b`

## Testbench File (`project_2.srcs/sim_1/fromBook/TestBenchWriting.v`)
- **Module name**: `mux_tb` (testbench)
- **Instantiates**: `mux_gl` module (matches the source file exactly)
- **Port connections**: All ports (`a`, `b`, `s`, `y`) are correctly connected
- **Test stimulus**: Provides various input combinations to test the multiplexer

## Perfect Match Verification:
1. ✅ **Module name**: Testbench instantiates `mux_gl` which matches the source module name
2. ✅ **Port names**: All ports (`a`, `b`, `s`, `y`) match exactly
3. ✅ **Port directions**: Input/output directions are consistent
4. ✅ **Functionality**: The testbench tests the multiplexer with different input combinations

The testbench correctly instantiates the `mux_gl` module and provides appropriate test vectors to verify the 2-to-1 multiplexer functionality. This is a proper testbench-source file pair for simulation.

should their module name be the same 

No, their module names should **NOT** be the same. Here's why:

## Current Setup (Correct):
- **Source file**: `module mux_gl` - This is the actual design/implementation
- **Testbench file**: `module mux_tb` - This is the test environment

## Why Different Names Are Correct:

1. **Different Purposes**:
   - `mux_gl` is the **Unit Under Test (UUT)** - the actual multiplexer circuit
   - `mux_tb` is the **testbench** - the testing environment that stimulates and monitors the UUT

2. **Instantiation Relationship**:
   - The testbench (`mux_tb`) **instantiates** the design module (`mux_gl`)
   - Line 9 in testbench: `mux_gl uut (...)` - this creates an instance of the `mux_gl` module

3. **Compilation Requirements**:
   - Both modules need unique names to avoid naming conflicts
   - The simulator needs to distinguish between the test environment and the design being tested

## Common Naming Conventions:
- **Design module**: `mux_gl`, `counter`, `alu`, etc.
- **Testbench module**: `mux_tb`, `counter_tb`, `alu_testbench`, etc.
- The `_tb` suffix clearly identifies it as a testbench

If they had the same name, you'd get a compilation error due to duplicate module definitions. The current setup is exactly how it should be!
