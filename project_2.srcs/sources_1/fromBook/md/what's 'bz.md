Let me read the full file to see the complete context around this `'bz` usage.

[1 tool called]

`'bz` in Verilog represents the **high-impedance state** (also called "tri-state" or "floating" state).

## What is `'bz`?

**`'bz`** stands for:
- **`'b`** = binary notation prefix
- **`z`** = high-impedance (Z-state)

## High-Impedance State Explained:

In digital circuits, there are actually **4 possible logic states**:
1. **`0`** - Logic LOW
2. **`1`** - Logic HIGH  
3. **`x`** - Unknown/Don't care
4. **`z`** - High-impedance (disconnected)

## When is `'bz` used?

High-impedance is crucial for:
1. **Tri-state buffers** - Can be enabled/disabled
2. **Bus systems** - Multiple drivers sharing the same wire
3. **Bidirectional pins** - Can be input or output

## Your Code Context:

Looking at lines 42-43:
```verilog
assign y = (s == 0)? a : 'bz,
y = (s == 1)? c : 'bz;
```

This appears to be implementing a **tri-state multiplexer**:
- When `s == 0`: output `a`, otherwise output is high-impedance
- When `s == 1`: output `c`, otherwise output is high-impedance

**Note:** There are syntax issues in this code:
1. Line 42 has a comma instead of semicolon
2. The logic suggests this should be two separate `assign` statements for a tri-state bus

## Correct Tri-state Example:
```verilog
assign y = (s == 0) ? a : 'bz;  // Driver 1
assign y = (s == 1) ? c : 'bz;  // Driver 2
```

When neither condition is true, `y` would be in high-impedance state, effectively "disconnecting" from the circuit.
