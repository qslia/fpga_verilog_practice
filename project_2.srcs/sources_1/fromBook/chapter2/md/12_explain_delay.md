Got it 👍 Let’s break this down line by line — this is **Verilog delay modeling**:

```verilog
// Delay examples
wire #5 y_delayed;       // net delay
assign #3 y_delayed = a & b;  // assignment delay
```

---

### 1. **`wire #5 y_delayed;` → Net delay**

* This means the **wire itself has 5 time units of delay**.
* Any signal that drives `y_delayed` will appear at the output of the wire **after 5 units of delay**.
* Think of it as: the wire behaves like a physical wire with propagation delay.

Example:
If `a & b` changes at **time 10**, then `y_delayed` will reflect that new value at **time 15** (10 + 5).

---

### 2. **`assign #3 y_delayed = a & b;` → Assignment delay**

* This means the **assignment has a 3 time unit delay**.
* So whenever `a & b` changes, the new value will be scheduled to update `y_delayed` **3 units later**.

Example:
If `a & b` changes at **time 10**, then `y_delayed` gets updated at **time 13**.

---

### 3. **Putting them together**

In your snippet, you used **both**:

* Net declaration with `#5`
* Continuous assignment with `#3`

👉 When both are used, the **assignment delay happens first**, then the **net delay** is applied.

So if `a & b` changes at **time 10**:

1. At **time 13**, the assignment schedules an update.
2. That update then passes through the wire delay of **5**.
3. Final output at **time 18**.

So the **total effective delay** = `3 + 5 = 8`.

---

✅ **Summary**:

* `wire #d` → adds *propagation delay on the wire*.
* `assign #d` → adds *delay to the assignment action*.
* If both are used, they **add up**.

Do you want me to also sketch a **timeline diagram** showing input changes vs. when `y_delayed` actually updates?
