Good question 👍

### 🔹 What is a LUT?

**LUT = Look-Up Table**.
In digital design (especially FPGAs), a LUT is a small memory structure used to **implement combinational logic**.

* You can think of it as a **truth table stored in memory**.
* Inputs (`s` in your example) act as the **address** (index).
* The output (`y`) is the **stored value** at that address.

So instead of building logic with AND/OR/NOT gates directly, the FPGA uses LUTs that store precomputed results.

### 🔹 Your Verilog Example

```verilog
module LUT (
    input [1:0] s,
    output reg y
);
    always @(s)
        case (s)
            2'b00: y = 0;
            2'b01: y = 1;
            2'b10: y = 1;
        endcase
endmodule
```

* Input `s` is **2 bits**, so it can represent 4 combinations (`00`, `01`, `10`, `11`).
* The `case` block defines the output `y` for each input pattern.

Effectively, this is a **2-to-1 truth table**:

| `s` | `y`                             |
| --- | ------------------------------- |
| 00  | 0                               |
| 01  | 1                               |
| 10  | 1                               |
| 11  | ? (undefined, since not listed) |

👉 This is exactly what a **look-up table (LUT)** does:

* Take inputs → use them as an index → output pre-defined values.

### 🔹 LUTs in FPGAs

* In real FPGA hardware, LUTs are **implemented as tiny SRAM memories**.
* A **4-input LUT** has 16 bits of memory (because 2⁴ = 16 possible input combinations).
* When you write `always @(s)` with `case`, the synthesis tool maps this behavior onto the FPGA's LUT hardware.

So your example is essentially a **2-input LUT** stored in the FPGA.

---

✅ **Summary**:
A LUT is a *memory-based way of realizing combinational logic*.
Your Verilog module defines a 2-input LUT, mapping certain input values to specific outputs.

Do you want me to also show how your `case` can be rewritten as a **truth table / Boolean equation** (`y = s[0] | s[1]`) that the LUT actually implements?
